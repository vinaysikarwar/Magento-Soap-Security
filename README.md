Magento-Soap-Security
=====================

Added a security of ip address validation in magento soap api

As magento only provides the security layer to apipass and key, so i have added one more security check - IP Address Validation.

Now if you have enabled the module and added the ip address in configuration.

Then when you request for the soap access, then it will allow only if the request from that ip address.

By using the module you can only allow user from single ip address, if you want to allow multiple ip addresses, contact me at blog@webtechnologycodes.com

Thanks
